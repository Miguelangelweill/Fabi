# the way we want it to be built
* Making sure that the page is compatible with all of the devices.
* A navigational bar that allows us to travel along the page without any struggle, make sure that there is always an option to go back to the original position.
* make sure the navigational bar has a z index pf 9 and a position fixed
* Create a jumbotron with a carousel effect of some images representing the craft.
* Make sure that the jubotron has a z-index of 4.
* Make the page one fluid page that only slides down no extra html's
* The area where our content is located should slide up above the jumbotron and and under the nav bar there for give it an z- index of 5.
* Make a contact button that redirects the user to an email that is being sent to fabiola with the mailto attribute .
* Either under the jumbotron or the contact page we should make a little section that talks about the biografy of how she got to the point she is today.
